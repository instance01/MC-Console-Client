MC-Console-Client
=================

MCCC: Minecraft Console Client for sending messages and commands without the 3D aspect of the game.


TODO
====

- [ ] JSON parsing
- [ ] premium support
- [ ] probably support for minecraft snapshots



As I only worked a few hours on that it's still pretty ugly (especially that the chat is a big unparsed JSON object), but I might finish that project soon.
